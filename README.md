## Topics

Day 64: assert(), breakpoints, view debugging, and debugging using print().

## Challenges

Day 65:

It was all about modifying previous projects. To see how it went, check out those projects in my repositories!

1. Temporarily try adding an exception breakpoint to project 1, then changing the call to instantiateViewController() so that it uses the storyboard identifier “Bad” – this will fail, but your exception breakpoint should catch it.
2. In project 1, add a call to assert() in the viewDidLoad() method of DetailViewController.swift, checking that selectedImage always has a value.
3. Go back to project 5, and try adding a conditional breakpoint to the start of the submit() method that pauses only if the user submits a word with six or more letters.
